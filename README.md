# Overview

 This repository contains Terraform IaC code and configuration for Deploying SDR Infrastructure resources to Microsoft Azure Platform.

 Terraform : Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code tool that greatly reduces the amount of time needed to implement and scale the infrastructure. It is provider agnostic.

 The folder structure of the IaC code is shown below.

- modules - Contains code for all the resources which can be reusable. 
- main.tf - Contains modules for all the resources which can be reusable.
- variables.tf - Contains the variables for all the modules/resources.

## Modules

## main.tf

- This file contains the resource configuration code. This file invokes the modules for the specific resources to be deployed on the Microsoft Azure Platform.
- Single module can be called multiple times to create the same set of resources with different naming conventions and configurations.

## Variables.tf

- Variables that are repeated / parameterized / environment specific, can be declared in variables.tf.

# Deployment Process

**Important Note:** Refer to the **[DDF SDR Azure Platform Setup and Deployment Guide](documents/ddf-sdr-azure-platform-setup-and-deployment-guide-v3.0.pdf)** and **[DDF SDR Azure Platform Design and Implementation Guide](documents/ddf-sdr-azure-platform-design-and-implementation-v2.0.pdf)** documents before following the below steps.

## Deployment Actions

The folder .github/workflows contains the GitHub Actions yaml script (main.yml) for deploying the Terraform IaC code on Microsoft Azure Platform.
  **name: Terraform Install**
  - task will install the terraform and it's dependencies on microsoft hosted agents to deploy the resources
      uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
      with:
         terraform_version: 0.14.11
         
  **name: Terraform Init**
  - initializes the terrafrom configuration files
      run:  terraform init -backend-config="storage_account_name=$STORAGE_ACCOUNT" -backend-config="container_name=$CONTAINER_NAME" -backend-config="resource_group_name=$RESOURCE_GROUP"  -backend-config="key=$Blob_Key" 
      
  **name: Terraform Plan**
  - task creates an execution plan which lets us to review the changes made to the environment before applying the changes
      run: terraform plan
           
  **name: Terraform Apply**
  - task execute the actions proposed in the terraform plan
      run: terraform apply -auto-approve

### main.yml

The yaml file is a multi-job script that will perform security checks on IaC code as well as the deployment of resources to the target environment on Microsoft Azure Platform.

- **Step 1 :** Go to GitHub Actions and under the list of workflows click on CI
- **Step 2 :** In this workflow click Run Workflow to trigger the Deployment Action
- **Step 3 :** Once the workflow completes successfully, refer to the **[DDF SDR Azure Platform Setup and Deployment Guide](https://github.com/transcelerate/ddf-sdr-platform/raw/main/documents/ddf-sdr-azure-platform-setup-and-deployment-guide-v3.0.pdf)** for additional manual configuration updates to the deployed resources and further deploy SDR Reference Implementation (RI) Application Code

**Important Note :** GitHub Actions does not allow multi-environment deployment setup with Free Pricing Plan. To Deploy to different environments, the GitHub secret values have to be updated with values of the target Azure Environment.
# Infrastructure Changes for Release V2.0

- The steps required to migrate SDR infrastructure from Version 0.5 to Version 2.0 for users who have set up their own SDR instance for the Study Definition Repository â€“ Reference Implementation on Azure Cloud Platform. It provides details for deploying the new resources using azure portal. Additionally, it provides details of containerized deployment for the SDR API and UI applications.

**Important Note:** Refer to the **[DDF SDR Infra Migration Guide (Release V2.0)](documents/DDF_SDR_Infra-Migration-guide (Release V2.0.pdf))** document before following the below steps. 

## Deployment Process for Release V2.0
## Steps to Migrate
**PRE-REQUISITES :**
- SDR Running instance on Azure (SDR Release V0.5).
- Minimum Contributor level of access at Subscription Level.
- Optionally, basic understanding of containerized deployments

   - **Step 1 :** Resources Configurations for Change Audit Feature
   - **Step 2 :**  Configuration for USDM Versioning
   - **Step 3 :**  Additional Cloud Configurations
   - **Step 4 :**  Build and Deployment Updates
## Containerized Deployment 
- The UI and API builds have been containerized as a part of SDR Release V2.0. The same has impacted the App Services on which the SDR Application is hosted. This section details the steps to enable containerized build and deployment. 
- This is an optional step. To continue with existing way of deployment of SDR use current App Service and Service Plan configuration and B&D scripts for UI and API for deployment as mentioned in section 3.4.2

  - **Step 1 :**  Recreate App Service Plans and App Services
  - **Step 2 :**  Create Azure Container Registry 
  - **Step 3 :**  GitHub Actions/YAML/Build & Deploy Script Updates
